# Oligopoly 

## points of improvement and todos
* did not implement help screen
* more space to work on expected revenues


## description

project for 새로매, Saeromae, immitating the behaviors of firms in an oligopoly market.

each player acts as an individual firm, attempting to maximize their respective revenues.

each firm has two options to invest to: 1. safe game and 2. risky game

the revenues are determined in percentages, in combination with differing target revenues

the initial intention is to provide a higher target revenue for non-popular risky game (i.e. if only a minority invested in the risky game)

however the percentage of earning that revenuei is low for non-popular risky game, which goes up as more firms join in in the riskiness.

on the contrary, safe game participants would have a higher percentage and a moderate revenue when the number of participants is a majority,

which diminishes as participants leave the investment

## discussion

however, as all strategic games are, this needs improvement

after performing the actual game and a few mock games, it turned out investing all assets in the safe game actually provides a higher income

i am not sure if this is a natural behavior of real life gambling. 

the problem here is that the gap between invsting entirely in safe game and entiirely in risky game was intensive.

also not sure if that must be a natural behavior irl.
